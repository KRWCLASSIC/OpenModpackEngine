# If you want to change installer file name you need to include it in all files that go back to this .bat file
# installer.bat refrences in:

- installer.bat
- src/misc/chg-mc-dir.bat
- src/installers/test.bat
- src/mainframe/module-informator.bat
- src/mainframe/module-interpreter.bat
- src/mainframe/module-installer.bat
- src/misc/tools/module-builder.bat

# How mainframe etc. works?

I use advantage of using "call" command that is passing variables to other scripts, using that i can extract info about modpack from OMEmodule
that is build to dont even showing itself to user, it gets executed, variables are getting set and everything gets passed for other scripts
like module-installer and module-informator to use
