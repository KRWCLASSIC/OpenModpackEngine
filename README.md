# FAQ (F = May get, lmao)

- Can i edit it for my modpack? -
Yes you can but i would prefer wait for standalone release, it will make it easier for everyone. (i mean bugs, errors etc.)
- Is it safe? -
If you mean OME on its own - Yes, if you dont belive you can read the code.
If you mean OME as a platform - Depends, if OMEmodule was created using built in creator yeah, but they can be editted to include malicious things so be aware and make sure you are using safe OMEmodules
- Why is this written in batch?
Because its easy and i know enough about it to make smth with it.
- Is this README copied from OptiPack?
Maybe?
