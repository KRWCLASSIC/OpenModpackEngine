# OpenModpackEngine

OpenModpackEngine is batch script for installing, managing and distributing modpacks without need of external/closed source apps like curseforge.

# Installation

As for now you only need to download and execute "installer.bat". This will download all requied files and apps (7-Zip included)

If you encounter bug that makes installer.bat crash without a reason, copy entire code to new .txt file, save and change extension to .bat or change line break type from LF to CRLF (Using tools like notepad++ in the bottom part of the window)

# Updating

As for now you need to remove entire program and reinstall it from github, updating mechanism will be added in beta, OME is now in alpha stage so fresh installing is better to remove potential bugs

# Modding

When full version will be released i have plans to add modding feature, basicly you can make OME use modified version of my scripts. This could be used to add new features i dont want to add or just for customization reasons (e.g. Modified installer.bat that changes font color for entire "app")

# FAQ (F = May get, lmao)

- Is it safe? -
If you mean OME on its own - Yes, if you dont belive you can read the code.

Because its easy and i know enough about it to make smth with it.
- Is this README copied from OptiPack? -
